This tool modifies a dashcam player software to be able to extract GPX data from the recorded *.TS videos.

I use it with a wolfbox dashcam. It seems to be based on Novatek hardware.

* INSTALL:

Copy Openstreetmap.html into the "setup" Folder of your CAR DVR Player Installation, usually

 C:\Program Files (x86)\CAR DVR PLAYER\setup

This will overwrite the original File, so backup it if you want to be able to revert this without reinstallation.

* USAGE:


+ Enter the date/time stamp seen in the video into the filed labeled S: in the form yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss, 
+ choose the snippet length in minites (default 3) in field D:
+ then press "Save"

Now the GPX content appears in the text area and is already selected, press Ctrl-C, go to your 
favorite text editor, paste the content and save as GPX file with extension ".gpx".

Done.
